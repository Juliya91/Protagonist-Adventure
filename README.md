## Overview

The idea has been inspired by Bundersnatch episode from Black Mirror series, but in this case it will be text based. There are many **"Choose your own adventure"** games, however most of them are done in the last century. **Rule the Story** is a way to bring back a retro game using new technologies.
 
## Description 

This project will have three pages, which are: "Home", "Story" and "Feedback" pages. The "Home" page has pop up box with a little description of the game, sound effect and **click here** button which leads user to "Story" page. The "Story" page has the game itself - text with two or more choices.

## UX  1

## Strategy

This website is targeting from teenagers to middle aged groups, for those who enjoy reading and would like to be truly involved in the story. Users here can choose how character will procceed, which will make them feel as part of the story. 

**User Stories**

#### As a First Time User:

- I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
- I want to intuitively navigate throughout the site and easily start the game itself.
- I want to see engaging design and content.

#### As a Frequent User: 

- I want the game being easily accepable and being able to get to it without too many clicks
- I want story to be interesting as well as choices options
- I want to be able to restart the game should I get to the dead end.

## Scope

- I have chosen simple design and navigation. The Home page to have pop up box with text animated gif/ image, click button as a link to the Story page and the welcome sound. At the top of each page to have navbar with the logo.
- For the Story page to have story text followed by the options to choose from and once certain options chosen to have images dispayed. Additionally, once user gets to dead end to have a sound effect.
- For the Feedback page to have contact input information and text area which once submited to have it sent to my email using emailjs.
- I have used mixed content of text, images and sounds.

## Structure

I decided to separate the website into three pages: the Home page, Begin Your Adventure page and Feedback page.

## Surface

I used a very simple layout with two predominant dark colors, while playing their shades. For logo I used rainbow text-shadow to give the pages retro look. All buttons, content boxes and input fields are in rounded shapes, which creates consistency and harmony throughout all 3 pages.


### Gif
- Gif was used for Home page to add a little bit of visual interactivity.
-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        - Main colors of the website are - black, purple and white. This colourscheme is consistant throughout all pages and in my opinion the best for retro look. For the buttons I used slightly lighter shade of purple with black borders and when hover over it reverses border and background colours. For the logo - rainbow text-shadow has been used.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Orbitron font used for logo/name of the website. While Play font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font isn't loading. 
        Orbitron is perfect for retro looking 
    -   #### Icons
        - Font Awesome was used for icons and they are psent on all pages: part of logo, next to links to summer & winter pages in the description on the home page and social links.
