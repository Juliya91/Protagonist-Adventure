## Overview

The idea has been inspired by Bundersnatch episode from Black Mirror series, but in this case it will be text based. There are many **"Choose your own adventure"** games, however most of them are done in the last century. **Rule the Story** is a way to bring back a retro game using new technologies.
 
## Description 

This project will have three pages, which are: "Home", "Story" and "Feedback" pages. The "Home" page has pop up box with a little description of the game, sound effect and **click here** button which leads user to "Story" page. The "Story" page has the game itself - text with two or more choices.

## UX  1

## Strategy

This website is targeting from teenagers to middle aged groups, for those who enjoy reading and would like to be truly involved in the story. Users here can choose how character will procceed, which will make them feel as part of the story. 

**User Stories**

#### As a First Time User:

- I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
- I want to intuitively navigate throughout the site and easily start the game itself.
- I want to see engaging design and content.

#### As a Frequent User: 

- I want the game being easily accepable and being able to get to it without too many clicks
- I want story to be interesting as well as choices options
- I want to be able to restart the game should I get to the dead end.

## Scope

- I have chosen simple design and navigation. The Home page to have pop up box with text animated gif/ image, click button as a link to the Story page and the welcome sound. At the top of each page to have navbar with the logo.
- For the Story page to have story text followed by the options to choose from and once certain options chosen to have images dispayed. Additionally, once user gets to dead end to have a sound effect.
- For the Feedback page to have contact input information and text area which once submited to have it sent to my email using emailjs.
- I have used mixed content of text, images and sounds.

## Structure

I decided to separate the website into three pages: the home page, story page and feedback page.

## Skeleton

- Home Page: <a href="assets/wireframes/" target="_blank" >Home</a>

- Story Page: <a href="assets/wireframes/" target="_blank" >Story</a>

- Feedback Page: <a href="assets/wireframes/" target="_blank" >Feedback</a>
